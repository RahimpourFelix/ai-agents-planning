# Pricing thoughts

## Assumptions

Currently, we plan with three auto-research processes per year.
We assume one user request calls 8 agents and 1 LLM.

## Step 1: Initalization

A customer with roughly 15 GB of data will need:

- 100m input tokens, roughly 2.50€/m
- 100m output tokens, roughly 15€/m
- 100m embedding model tokens, roughly 3€/m

This results in a cost of ~2050€.

## Auto-Research

An auto-research process will be started 30 days after the data was intially loaded.
Auto research means the system tries to improve the data based on Knowlestry Intelligence.

We expect the same processing cost as the initialization, plus addition costs for Knowlestry Intelligence.

Since there is no information on costs at this point, we assume factor 2 and calculate costs 4100€ for 15 GB of data.

## Costs of user interaction

### Traffic costs

Assuming a customer with 15 GB has 200 users, generating 30 questions a day, which results in 6000 requests per day.

A user question may contain 10 sentences. With an average of 5-6 characters per word the incoming message might contain 800-1200 characters.
UTF-8 has 1 byte per character, which results in ~1KB per user message

A LLM might respond 2-5x longer then the question, which could result in ~3KB per response.

With 6000 messages roughly 24 MB of traffice are consumed every day.

### LLM traffic

The system might send enriched questions to an LLM. 
Using chat history, RAG chunks, prompts, or other data a request can be between 20-40 KB.
When the response stays the same and we assume 30 KB as input, the traffic would be 180MB per day.

### Internal traffic

Internal traffic is hard to calculate at this point; however, if agents pass 8 calls per request, and the payload is 25 KB request and 25 reply, a single call might cause 50 KB of traffic.

Internal traffic might result in 400 KB per request, which results into 2.4 GB/day based on 6000 requests.

### Traffic per month

Traffic from user to system, and system to LLM could be roughly 204 MB/day, which results to ~6.2 GB/month.

Internal traffic adds ~72 GB/month.

### Max traffic

Assuming traffic of 500 KB per request and 5 servers with a max traffic capacity of 20 TB, a loadbalanced setup migth serve around 1.3m requests per day.

Excluded are calls to the database.

### Optimizations

To avoid repeated copy of message for performance and traffic reasons, 
specific databases (like Redis) can be used to pass conversation IDs around and let agents read only what they need.
The planned monitoring database could serve as such a storage.

## Server specifics

- Ingress: Spring API/Chat, loadbalanced
- Workers: 8 agents, grouped on worker machines
- Data: Postgres, Mevius setup

Asumptions:

6,000 requests/day = 0.07 requests/second average
100,000 requests/day = 1.16 requests/second average
1,000,000 requests/day = 11.6 requests/second average

Expectations:

- LLM calls can be long
- Passing from agent to agent may sum up
- Bursts during work hours

## Rough estimate of price per request

The dominant factor fo cost is LLM usage with adding 0.02-0.04€ per request.
Infrastructure decreases with scale, down to 0.001-0.002€

A request to Knowlestry causes a cost of roughly 0.025-0.045€.
